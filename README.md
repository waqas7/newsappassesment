# NewsApp Asspi.orgesment for Internship at Markeble by Muhammad Waqas Khan

A bit overview, it uses news API to get news and get JSON data back. Then it is parsed using google's gson library and the requests are sent by Retrofit.

#### Note: To run the app you have to add [NewsAPI.org](https://newsapi.org/register) key. I have taken this step to due to limited access to daily request for News. Getting a key would take just few seconds :)
